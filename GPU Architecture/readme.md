# GPU Architecture

***Note: Currently not working on this part now.***


## Goal
- This part of the repo is meant to supplement the kernel optimizations that we will be doing, by giving us a deep understanding of the components of a GPU and an intuition for how to optimize a given kernel for a given problem.
- This ***wont*** be easy: I will try into depth on parts of the GPU not usually covered, and challenging any assumptions not based on understanding.
