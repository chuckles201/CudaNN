# CUDA Neural Network

Hello, in this repository I will be coding a neural network (architecture TBD) from scratch with only C and CUDA.

This is for educational purposes primarily, but hopefuly it can acheive some cool results, and really push towards
the cutting edge of DL library speeds through high quality kernels.
